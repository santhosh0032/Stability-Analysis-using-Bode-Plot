# Stability-Analysis-using-Bode-Plot
## Aim:
To analyse the stability of the system having open loop transfer function, G(S)=1/(S(1+0.5S)(1+0.1S)) using bode plot and verify it using MATLAB. 
## Apparatus Required:
Computer with MATLAB software

## Theory:



## Procedure:
	Open MATLAB software
	Open a new script file.
	Type the program.
	Save and Execute the program.
	Determine the gain crossover frequency, phase cross over frequency, gain margin and phase margin.
	Also determine the stability.

## Program: 

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the bode plot for the given transfer function was drawn and verified using MATLAB. <br>
Gain margin = <br>
Phase Margin = <br>
Gain crossover frequency = <br>
Phase crossover frequency = <br>
The system is  ------------
